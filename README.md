Diabetes Prediction This project utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on various health parameters. The goal is to provide an accurate, easy-to-use tool that can assist in early diagnosis and potentially guide patients toward appropriate medical care.

Overview Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection and management are crucial for improving patient outcomes and quality of life. This project leverages a dataset containing various health metrics to train a predictive model that can determine the probability of a patient having diabetes.

Features Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis. Exploratory Data Analysis: Understanding the data through visualizations and statistical summaries. Model Training: Implementing various machine learning algorithms to train the predictive model. Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the model using appropriate metrics. Prediction: Using the trained model to predict diabetes status on new data.
